What is Marpa?
--------------

Marpa is a new kind of parser.


Getting the code
----------------

Marpa is a Perl library. We will use
[Marpa::R2](http://metacpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2) for the examples in this guide.

If you have Perl already installed you can install Marpa with `cpan` or `cpanm`.

    $ cpan Marpa::R2

or

    $ cpanm Marpa::R2

This will install Marpa::R2.

In the rest of this guide we'll assume you have installed Marpa::R2. The examples
that end in '.pl' can be executed.

First example
-------------

Let's start with an example. What follows is the smallest code that could parse
a number.

!include "examples/number.pl"

In this example we parse a number using the `\d` character class. The character
classes used by Marpa are the same as those used by Perl.

You can run the code by calling it with `perl`.

    $ perl number.pl 9999
    Trying to parse:
    9999
    ok

In the next sections we'll just use the notation used by Marpa.

!include "examples/number2.pl"

Marpa uses the `:start` rule to specify which rule should be matched first. The
declaration operator `::=` separates the left side from the right side.

The symbol on the left side of the declaration operator is the name of the rule.
The symbols on the right side of the operator specify what it matches to.

The next example shows how easy it is to improve that grammar to parse multiple
numbers separated by whitespace.

!include "examples/numbers.pl"

As you can see it includes a new rule called `numbers`. This rule matches with
one or more numbers. We specify this with the `+` operator after a name.

At the end of the `numbers` rule we specify the token that separates the
numbers, in this case the `<ws>` token. We do this by adding the `separator`
adverb. Abverbs can be used as options to a grammar rule. Lexical rules don't
support adverbs.

The `number` token stays the same and we add a new lexical rule for whitespace.

This grammar will parse input strings like this following.

    123    9 45 83 1000 1001          39201

The input string with numbers could be much longer than this as long as each
number is separated by one or more whitespace characters. This includes spaces,
tabs and newlines.

### Lexical rules

A lexical rule specifies which characters can be matched in the input string. A
lexical rule can contain character classes and quoted strings.

A character class specifies each character or group of characters that can be
matched. These character classes are evaluated by Perl. This means that
everything that would work in Perl itself, can be used in a Marpa character
class. We already saw how to match a number. This is how you could match a
variable name.

!include "examples/identifier.pl"

The rule for matching an identifier (or name) is split into two rules. The first
rule specifies the structure of the token. The first part of it matches the
first character of an identifier. It can be an underscore, a lowercase
character or an uppercase character. It can't be a number however.  
The second part `id_rest` references the second rule, which specifies the
rest of the identifier. This can include numbers as well. The asterisk `*` at the
end says that this character class can match zero of more times.

The asterisk is also the reason why we split the identifier rule into two
parts. The asterisk can only be used on rules with a single item on the right
hand side.

A lexical rule can also use a quoted string. A quoted string are surrounded
with single quotes `'`. The text between the quotes will match as literal text.
You could use this for single characters or keywords.

    kw_for    ~ 'for'
    kw_if     ~ 'if'
