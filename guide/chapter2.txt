Chapter 2 - Parsing Numbers
===========================

!include "guide/menu.inc"

Let's start with an example. What follows is the smallest code that parses a
list of numbers.

!include "examples/number.pl"

In this example we parse a few numbers separated by spaces. Let's run the code first.
You can run the code by calling it with `perl`.

    $ perl number.pl
    Trying to parse:
    1 3 5 8 13 21 34 55

    Output:
    $VAR1 = [
        '1',
        '3',
        '5',
        '8',
        '13',
        '21',
        '34',
        '55'
    ];

The example shows which text it tries to parse followed by the array that it
found.

In the next sections we'll just show the notation used by Marpa. The examples
contain the full code.

!include "examples/number2.pl"

In the specification language that Marpa uses, the `:start` rule specifies
which rule is the top most rule that should match. The declaration operator
`::=` separates the name of the rule, on left side, from the specification, on the right side.

The symbol on the left side of the declaration operator is the name of the
rule. The symbols on the right side of the operator specify what it matches
to.

According to the `:start` declaration Marpa will start to parse from the
`numbers` rule. The `numbers` rule contains `number` followed by a `+`
operator. The `+` operator lets Marpa know that we expect one or more `number`
lexemes.

The next line specifies what a number looks like. The `~` operator separates the name of the token
from the character class on the right. We specify `number` to be one or more digits. Marpa uses the
same character classes as Perl does internally.

Then we specify a `:discard` rule. With this we can specify what tokens Marpa
can discard. The input language contains whitespace between the numbers. With
the `ws` rule we say what this looks like.

This grammar will parse input strings like the following.

    123    9 45 83 1000 1001          39201

The input string with numbers could be much longer than this as long as each
number is separated by one or more whitespace characters. This includes spaces,
tabs and newlines.

### Lexical rules

The rules `ws` and `number` are examples of lexical rules. A lexical rule
specifies which characters can be matched in the input string. A lexical rule
can contain character classes and quoted strings.

A character class specifies each character or group of characters that can be
matched. These character classes are evaluated by Perl. This means that
everything that would work in Perl itself, can be used in a Marpa character
class. We already saw how to match a number. This is how you could match a
variable name.

!include "examples/identifier.pl"

The rule for matching an identifier (or name) is split into two rules. The first
rule specifies the structure of the token. The first part of it matches the
first character of an identifier. It can be an underscore, a lowercase
character or an uppercase character. It can't be a number however.
The second part `id_rest` references the second rule, which specifies the
rest of the identifier. This can include numbers as well. The asterisk `*` at the
end says that this character class can match zero or more times.

The asterisk is also the reason why we split the identifier rule into two
parts. The asterisk can only be used on rules with a single item on the right
hand side.

A lexical rule can also use a quoted string. A quoted string is surrounded
with single quotes `'`. The text between the quotes will match as literal text.
You could use this for single characters or keywords.

    kw_for    ~ 'for'
    kw_if     ~ 'if'
