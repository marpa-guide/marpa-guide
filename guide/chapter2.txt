Chapter 2 - Parsing Numbers
===========================

!include "guide/menu.inc"

Let's start with an example. What follows is the smallest code that parses a
list of numbers.

!include "examples/number.pl"

In this example we parse a few numbers separated by spaces. Let's run the code first.
You can run the code by calling it with `perl`.

    $ perl number.pl
    Trying to parse:
    1 3 5 8 13 21 34 55

    Output:
    $VAR1 = [
        '1',
        '3',
        '5',
        '8',
        '13',
        '21',
        '34',
        '55'
    ];

The example shows which text it tries to parse followed by the array that it
found.

In the next sections we'll just show the notation used by Marpa. The examples
contain the full code.

!include "examples/number2.pl"

In the specification language that Marpa uses, the `:start` rule specifies
which rule is the top most rule that should match. The declaration operator
`::=` separates the name of the rule, on left side, from the specification, on the right side.

The symbol on the left side of the declaration operator is the name of the
rule. The symbols on the right side of the operator specify what it matches
to.

According to the `:start` declaration Marpa will start to parse from the
`numbers` rule. The `numbers` rule contains `number` followed by a `+`
operator. The `+` operator lets Marpa know that we expect one or more `number`
lexemes.

The next line specifies what a number looks like. The `~` operator separates the name of the token
from the character class on the right. We specify `number` to be one or more digits. Marpa uses the
same character classes as Perl does internally.

Then we specify a `:discard` rule. With this we can specify what tokens Marpa
can discard. The input language contains whitespace between the numbers. With
the `ws` rule we say what this looks like.

This grammar will parse input strings like the following.

    123    9 45 83 1000 1001          39201

The input string with numbers could be much longer than this as long as each
number is separated by one or more whitespace characters. This includes spaces,
tabs and newlines.

### Lexical rules

The rules `ws` and `number` are examples of lexical rules. A lexical rule
specifies which characters can be matched in the input string. A lexical rule
can contain character classes and quoted strings.

A character class specifies each character or group of characters that can be
matched. These character classes are evaluated by Perl. This means that
everything that would work in Perl itself, can be used in a Marpa character
class. We already saw how to match a number. This is how you could match a
variable name.

!include "examples/identifier.pl"

The rule for matching an identifier (or name) is split into two rules. The first
rule specifies the structure of the token. The first part of it matches the
first character of an identifier. It can be an underscore, a lowercase
character or an uppercase character. It can't be a number however.
The second part `id_rest` references the second rule, which specifies the
rest of the identifier. This can include numbers as well. The asterisk `*` at the
end says that this character class can match zero of more times.

The asterisk is also the reason why we split the identifier rule into two
parts. The asterisk can only be used on rules with a single item on the right
hand side.

A lexical rule can also use a quoted string. A quoted string is surrounded
with single quotes `'`. The text between the quotes will match as literal text.
You could use this for single characters or keywords.

    kw_for    ~ 'for'
    kw_if     ~ 'if'

### Keywords

Let's take a look at a small declarative part of a language with two keywords: 'Deny', 'Allow'.

    Deny baduser
    Allow admin

The semantics (or meaning) of the language could be anything. Parsing the
language can be really easy with Marpa.

!include "examples/deny-allow.pl"

    Trying to parse:
    Deny baduser
    Allow admin

    Output:
    $VAR1 = [
        [
            'Deny',
            'baduser'
        ],
        [
            'Allow',
            'admin'
        ]
    ];

The output shows that Marpa parsed two rules. The first rule with the
'Deny' keyword and the second with the 'Allow' keyword. It seems that the
keywords could interfere with the usernames. The `cmd_type`s are a subset of
the usernames.

Let's see what happens when we change the first username from baduser to Allow.
Can Marpa see the difference between keywords and usernames?

    Output:
    $VAR1 = [
        [
            'Deny',
            'Allow'
        ],
        [
            'Allow',
            'admin'
        ]
    ];

It doesn't matter that the first username matches a `cmd_type`. Marpa knows
that the word 'Allow' could also be a username.

Now let's see what happens when we use an input that doesn't match by switching
around the username and the keyword. A keyword could be a username, but it
can't be the other way around.

I change the input to:

    baduser Deny
    admin Allow

When we run the examples we get the following output:

    Error in SLIF G1 read: No lexemes accepted at position 0
    * String before error: baduser
    * The error  was at line 1, column 8, and at character 0x0020 (non-graphic character), ...
    * here:  Deny\nadmin Allow\n
    Marpa::R2 exception at examples/deny-allow.pl line 33.

Marpa tries to point to the error as best as it can. Marpa starts with the
problem: `No lexemes accepted at position 0`. This is Marpa's way of telling us
that Marpa couldn't find a way to match `baduser` to one of the expected
lexemes, `Deny` or `Allow`.

### More syntax

Now let's add a way to specify groups of users. The syntax could look like this.

    admins = admin root
    Deny baduser
    Allow @admins

The first line specifies a list of admin users. The second line stays the same
and the third line contains a reference to the `admins` list of users. The `@`
operators makes it a reference.

We start by changing the input in the file. We run the code and find that it
doesn't parse. That's what we expected.

Now we need to add a rule for parsing the `admins = ...` line. In this case
`admins` is similar to a username so let's use that.

    user_list  ::= username '=' username username

This line should work. We add it in the grammar. Let's add it to the
`rule` rule as an alternative. We use the `|` (or) operator.

    rule    ::= cmd_type username
              | user_list

When we run this code we get the following:

    Lexing failed at unacceptable character 0x0040 '@'
    Marpa::R2 exception at examples/deny-allow2.pl line 37.

Marpa doesn't like the '@' character in the third line. Let's add that.
We add another line to `rule`. The reference is like a username.

!include "examples/deny-allow2.pl"

When we run this code, the parse succeeds, but the result is not completely right.

    [
        'Allow',
        '@',
        'admins'
    ]

The `@` and `admins` is parsed in two parts. We like the reference to be a
single thing. Another problem with this version is that there can be spaces
between the '@' and the name after it. This is not what we mean. The '@' and
the name should always be part of the same lexeme. We change this by making a
lexical rule for the `list_ref`.

**When two tokens should never be separated, make them part of the same lexical rule.**

!include "examples/deny-allow3.pl"

Now let's run `deny-allow3.pl`.

    Symbol <username> is a lexeme in G1, but not in G0.
      This may be because <username> was used on a RHS in G0.
      A lexeme cannot be used on the RHS of a G0 rule.
    Marpa::R2 exception at examples/deny-allow3.pl line 6.

This gives us a look into the inner workings of Marpa. This error message says
that we can't use a lexeme in both the structural rules (G1) and lexical rules
(G0). We need to create two lexical rules: one for `rule` and `user_list` and
one for `list_ref`.

!include "examples/deny-allow4.pl"

With these changes we can parse the input without problems. The output shows
what we expected.

### Multiple users

Even though the code works, it could be that you saw a problem with this. Ask
yourself what would happen if you specify more or less than two users on the
right side of a `user_list`? Try it.

The parser doesn't know what to do with the extra user in the list.
Let's change `user_list` to allow multiple users.

!include "examples/deny-allow5.pl"

This change now allows us to specify multiple users in a user_list. The change
that allows us to specify multiple users on an `Allow` or `Deny` line is
featured in Exercise 1.1.

With that change this language allows us to easily specify users that are
allowed or denied access to a particular thing. The design of the language
leaves out the specification of that particular thing to keep the design simple
and general.

### Exercise

1. **Multiple users** &mdash; Change the grammar to allow multiple users on the
`Allow` or `Deny` line. For example:

        Allow root admin
        Deny baduser cracker

2. **All users** &mdash; Add a rule that allows you to specify `all` or
'everybody' as a rule that denies or allows everyone.

3. **Implementation** &mdash; Implement a class `Authorization` with a method
`CanAccess($username)` that return true if a user is allowed access and false
if the user is denied access. The contructor of the class takes a source string
in the language that we specified above. The rules that the parser creates
should be checked in sequence.
