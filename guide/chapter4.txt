Chapter 3 - Parsing an Expression
=================================

!include "guide/menu.inc"

Parsers shine in situations where there are many discrete parts in sequence
with a certain structure. A grammar describes the rules of this structure.

The discrete parts of the structure are the lexemes (or tokens) that make up
the sequences. The lexemes are groups of one or more characters. These are the
atoms of the language.

Any group of characters will do. And the nice thing is that for a grammar it
doesn't matter what these characters look like. The rules of the grammar only
describe how these lexeme relate to each other.

Let's start with a little example of an input string.

    100+200

The lexemes of this input string depends of the language. Let's say we want to
create a grammar that understands the structure of a number followed by an
operator "+", followed by another number.

    language ::= number op_plus number

In Marpa this means `language` is defined as `number` followed by `op_plus`
followed by `number`. Marpa doesn't know what each of the names means. To remedy that we will
write the definitions of the lexemes.

    number  ~ [\d]+
    op_plus ~ '+'

The complete grammar looks like the following.

!include "examples/number2-1.pl"

When we run the program we get the output that follows:

    Trying to parse:
    100+200
    Output:
    $VAR1 = [
        '100',
        '+',
        '200'
    ];

## Whitespace

Now try and add some whitespace between certain tokens. A space after the first
number. Marpa will complain that it can't lex a certain character:

    Lexing failed at unacceptable character 0x0020 (non-graphic character)

We would like to be able to parse expression with whitespace between them.
There are two ways to do that. One way is to add a whitespace lexeme in every
place where whitespace could occur. Let start with an example.

!include "examples/number2-2.pl"

We fix the whitespace problem by adding an optional whitespace token at every
place where it could occur. This makes for one big mess, especially if you have
many rules, each with specific whitespace requirements.

The other way to parse rules with whitespace in between lexemes is with the
`:discard` pseudo rule. This rule allow you to specify which parts of the input
stream Marpa should discard when it encounters these.
